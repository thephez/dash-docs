# GetTxOutProof

The `gettxoutproof` RPC returns a hex-encoded proof that one or more specified transactions were included in a block.

NOTE: By default this function only works when there is an
unspent output in the UTXO set for this transaction. To make it always work,
you need to maintain a transaction index, using the `-txindex` command line option, or
specify the block in which the transaction is included in manually (by block header hash).

*Parameter #1---the transaction hashes to prove*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
TXIDs | array | Required<br>(exactly 1) | A JSON array of txids to filter
→<br>`txid` | string | Required<br>(1 or more) | TXIDs of the transactions to generate proof for.  All transactions must be in the same block

*Parameter #2---the block to look for txids in*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Header hash | string | Optional<br>(0 or 1) | If specified, looks for txid in the block with this hash

*Result---serialized, hex-encoded data for the proof*

Name | Type | Presence | Description

# PreciousBlock

*Added in Dash Core 0.12.3 / Bitcoin Core 0.14.0*

The `preciousblock` RPC treats a block as if it were received before others with the same work. A later `preciousblock` call can override the effect of an earlier one. The effects of `preciousblock` are not retained across restarts.

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Header Hash | string (hex) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The hash of the block to mark as precious

*Result---`null` or error on failure*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`result` | null | Required<br>(exactly 1) | JSON `null`.  The JSON-RPC error field will be set only if you entered an invalid block hash

*Example from Dash Core 0.12.3*

``` bash
dash-cli preciousblock 00000000034d77e287b63922a94f12e8c4ab9e\
1d8056060fd51f6153ea5dc757
```

Result (no output from `dash-cli` because result is set to `null`).

# PruneBlockChain

**Details of the `data-hex` field:**

The `data-hex` field is comprised of a JSON object as described in [GObject
Deserialize](#gobject-deserialize) which is serialized to hex.

An example of a proposal JSON object is shown here:

``` json
{
  "end_epoch": 1560457055,
  "name": "test",
  "payment_address": "yd5KMREs3GLMe6mTJYr3YrH1juwNwrFCfB",
  "payment_amount": 5,
  "start_epoch": 1560453490,
  "type": 1,
  "url": "http://test.com"
}
```

To serialize the object, first remove all spaces from the JSON object as shown below:

``` json
{"end_epoch":1560457055,"name":"test","payment_address":"yd5KMREs3GLMe6mTJYr3YrH1juwNwrFCfB","payment_amount":5,"start_epoch":1560453490,"type":1,"url":"http://test.com"}
```

Then convert the string to its hex equivalent as shown below. This is what will
be used for the `data-hex` field of the `gobject prepare` command:

``` bash
7b22656e645f65706f6368223a313536303435373035352c226e616d65223a2274657374222c\

*Parameter #2---detailed*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---

## Quorum Sign

The `quorum sign` RPC requests threshold-signing for a message.

![Warning icon](https://dash-docs.github.io/img/icons/icon_warning.svg) Note: Used for RegTest testing only.

*Parameter #1---LLMQ Type*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`llmqType` | number | Required<br>(exactly 1) | [Type of quorum](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0006.md#current-llmq-types):<br>`1` - LLMQ_50_60<br>`2` - LLMQ_400_60<br>`3` - LLMQ_400_85

*Parameter #2---id*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`id` | string (hex) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | Signing request ID

*Parameter #3---message hash*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`msgHash` | string (hex) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | Hash of the message to be signed

*Result---status*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
result | bool | Required<br>(exactly 1) | True or false depending on success

*Example from Dash Core 0.14.0*

``` bash
dash-cli -testnet quorum sign 1 \
  "abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234" \
  "51c11d287dfa85aef3eebb5420834c8e443e01d15c0b0a8e397d67e2e51aa239"
```

Result:
``` json
false
```

## Quorum GetRecSig

The `quorum getrecsig` RPC checks gets the recovered signature for a previous threshold-signing message request.

*Parameter #1---LLMQ Type*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`llmqType` | number | Required<br>(exactly 1) | [Type of quorum](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0006.md#current-llmq-types):<br>`1` - LLMQ_50_60<br>`2` - LLMQ_400_60<br>`3` - LLMQ_400_85

*Parameter #2---id*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---

# GetNetworkHashPS

The `getnetworkhashps` RPC returns the estimated network hashes per second based on the last n blocks.

*Parameter #1---number of blocks to average*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`blocks` | number (int) | Optional<br>(0 or 1) | The number of blocks to average together for calculating the estimated hashes per second.  Default is `120`.  Use `-1` to average all blocks produced since the last difficulty change

*Parameter #2---block height*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`height` | number (int) | Optional<br>(0 or 1) | The height of the last block to use for calculating the average.  Defaults to `-1` for the highest-height block on the local best block chain.  If the specified height is higher than the highest block on the local best block chain, it will be interpreted the same as `-1`

*Result---estimated hashes per second*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`result` | number (int) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The estimated number of hashes per second based on the parameters provided.  May be 0 (for Height=`0`, the genesis block) or a negative value if the highest-height block averaged has a block header time earlier than the lowest-height block averaged

*Example from Dash Core 0.12.2*

Get the average hashes per second for all the blocks since the last
difficulty change before block 6000.

``` bash
dash-cli -testnet getnetworkhashps -1 6000
```

Result:

# PrioritiseTransaction

The `prioritisetransaction` RPC adds virtual priority or fee to a transaction, allowing it to be accepted into blocks mined by this node (or miners which use this node) with a lower priority or fee. (It can also remove virtual priority or fee, requiring the transaction have a higher priority or fee to be accepted into a locally-mined block.)

*Parameter #1---the TXID of the transaction to modify*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
TXID | string | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The TXID of the transaction whose virtual priority or fee you want to modify, encoded as hex in RPC byte order

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Fee | number (int) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | **Warning:** this value is in duffs, not Dash<br><br>If positive, the virtual fee to add to the actual fee paid by the transaction; if negative, the virtual fee to subtract from the actual fee paid by the transaction.  No change is made to the actual fee paid by the transaction

*Result---`true` if the priority is changed*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`result` | bool (true only) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | Always set to `true` if all three parameters are provided.  Will not return an error if the TXID is not in the memory pool.  If fewer or more than three arguments are provided, or if something goes wrong, will be set to `null`

# Ping {#ping-rpc}

The `ping` RPC sends a P2P ping message to all connected nodes to measure ping time. Results are provided by the `getpeerinfo` RPC pingtime and pingwait fields as decimal seconds. The P2P `ping` message is handled in a queue with all other commands, so it measures processing backlog, not just network ping.

*Parameters: none*

*Result---`null`*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`result` | null | Required | Always JSON `null`

*Example from Dash Core 0.12.2*

``` bash
dash-cli -testnet ping
```

(Success: no result printed.)

Get the results using the `getpeerinfo` RPC:

``` bash
dash-cli -testnet getpeerinfo | grep ping
```

Results:

``` json
        "pingtime" : 0.11790800,
        "pingtime" : 0.22673400,

# FundRawTransaction

*Requires wallet support.*

The `fundrawtransaction` RPC adds inputs to a transaction until it has enough in value to meet its out value.  This will not modify existing inputs, and will add one change output to the outputs.
Note that inputs which were signed may need to be resigned after completion since in/outputs have been added.  The inputs added will not be signed, use signrawtransaction for that.
All existing inputs must have their previous output transaction be in the wallet.

*Parameter #1---The hex string of the raw transaction*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Hexstring | string (hex) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The hex string of the raw transaction

*Parameter #2---Additional options*

Note: For backwards compatibility, passing in a `true` instead of an object will result in {\"includeWatching\":true}\n"

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Options | Object | Optional<br>(0 or 1) | *Added in Bitcoin Core 0.13.0*<br><br>Additional options
→ <br>`changeAddress` | string | Optional<br>(0 or 1) | The bitcoin address to receive the change. If not set, the address is chosen from address pool
→ <br>`changePosition` | nummeric (int) | Optional<br>(0 or 1) | The index of the change output. If not set, the change position is randomly chosen
`includeWatching` | bool | Optional<br>(0 or 1) | Inputs from watch-only addresses are also considered. The default is `false`
→ <br>`lockUnspent` | bool | Optional<br>(0 or 1) | The selected outputs are locked after running the rpc call. The default is `false`
→ <br>`reserveChangeKey` | bool | Optional<br>(0 or 1) | *Deprecated and ignored in Dash Core 0.14.1*<br><br>Reserves the change output key from the keypool. The default is `true`. Before Bitcoin Core 0.14.0, the used keypool key was never marked as change-address key and directly returned to the keypool (leading to address reuse).  
→ <br>`feeRate` | numeric (bitcoins) | Optional<br>(0 or 1) | The specific feerate  you are willing to pay(BTC per KB). If not set, the wallet determines the fee
→ <br>`subtractFeeFromOutputs` | array | Optional<br>(0 or 1) | A json array of integers. The fee will be equally deducted from the amount of each specified output. The outputs are specified by their zero-based index, before any change output is added.
→ →<br>Output index | numeric (int) | Optional<br>(0 or more) | A output index number (vout) from which the fee should be subtracted. If multiple vouts are provided, the total fee will be divided by the number of vouts listed and each vout will have that amount subtracted from it.

*Result---information about the created transaction*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`result` | object | Required<br>(exactly 1) | An object including information about the created transaction
→ <br>hex | string (hex) | Required<br>(Exactly 1) | The resulting unsigned raw transaction in serialized transaction format encoded as hex
→ <br>fee | numeric (bitcoins) | Required<br>(Exactly 1) | Fee in BTC the resulting transaction pays
→ <br>changepos | numeric (int) | Required<br>(Exactly 1) | The position of the added change output, or `-1` if no change output was added

*Example from Dash Core 0.12.2*

``` bash
dash-cli -testnet fundrawtransaction 01000000000100205fa012000000\
1976a914485485425fa99504ec1638ac4213f3cfc9f32ef388ac00000000

# GetRawTransaction

The `getrawtransaction` RPC gets a hex-encoded serialized transaction or a JSON object describing the transaction. By default, Dash Core only stores complete transaction data for UTXOs and your own transactions, so the RPC may fail on historic transactions unless you use the non-default `txindex=1` in your Dash Core startup settings.

Note: By default this function only works for mempool transactions. If the
`-txindex` option is enabled, it also works for blockchain transactions. For now,
it also works for transactions with unspent outputs although this feature is
deprecated.

*Parameter #1---the TXID of the transaction to get*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
TXID | string (hex) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The TXID of the transaction to get, encoded as hex in RPC byte order

*Parameter #2---whether to get the serialized or decoded transaction*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Format | bool | Optional<br>(0 or 1) | *Updated in Dash Core 0.12.3 / Bitcoin Core 0.14.0*<br><br>Set to `false` (the default) to return the serialized transaction as hex.  Set to `true` to return a decoded transaction.  Before 0.12.3, use `0` and `1`, respectively

*Result (if transaction not found)---`null`*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`result` | null | Required<br>(exactly 1) | If the transaction wasn't found, the result will be JSON `null`.  This can occur because the transaction doesn't exist in the block chain or memory pool, or because it isn't part of the transaction index.  See the Dash Core `-help` entry for `-txindex`

*Result (if verbose=`false`)---the serialized transaction*

Name | Type | Presence | Description

# SendRawTransaction

The `sendrawtransaction` RPC validates a transaction and broadcasts it to the peer-to-peer network.

*Parameter #1---a serialized transaction to broadcast*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Transaction | string (hex) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The serialized transaction to broadcast encoded as hex

*Parameter #2--whether to allow high fees*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Allow High Fees | bool | Optional<br>(0 or 1) | Set to `true` to allow the transaction to pay a high transaction fee.  Set to `false` (the default) to prevent Bitcoin Core from broadcasting the transaction if it includes a high fee.  Transaction fees are the sum of the inputs minus the sum of the outputs, so this high fees check helps ensures user including a change address to return most of the difference back to themselves

*Parameter #3--whether to use InstantSend*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Use InstantSend | bool | Optional<br>(0 or 1) | *Depcrecated and ignored since Dash Core 0.14.1*

*Result---a TXID or error message*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`result` | null/string (hex) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | If the transaction was accepted by the node for broadcast, this will be the TXID of the transaction encoded as hex in RPC byte order.  If the transaction was rejected by the node, this will set to `null`, the JSON-RPC error field will be set to a code, and the JSON-RPC message field may contain an informative error message

*Examples from Dash Core 0.12.2*

Broadcast a signed transaction:

``` bash
dash-cli -testnet sendrawtransaction 01000000016b490886c0198b\

--- | --- | --- | ---
Address | string (base58) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The P2PKH address corresponding to the private key which made the signature.  A P2PKH address is a hash of the public key corresponding to the private key which made the signature.  When the ECDSA signature is checked, up to four possible ECDSA public keys will be reconstructed from from the signature; each key will be hashed and compared against the P2PKH address provided to see if any of them match.  If there are no matches, signature validation will fail

*Parameter #2---the signature*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Signature | string (base64) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The signature created by the signer encoded as base-64 (the format output by the `signmessage` RPC)

*Parameter #3---the message*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Message | string | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The message exactly as it was signed (e.g. no extra whitespace)

*Result: `true`, `false`, or an error*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`result` | boolean | Required<br>(exactly 1) | Set to `true` if the message was signed by a key corresponding to the provided P2PKH address; set to `false` if it was not signed by that key; set to JSON `null` if an error occurred

*Example from Dash Core 0.12.2*

Check the signature on the message created in the example for
`signmessage`:

``` bash
dash-cli -testnet verifymessage \
  yNpezfFDfoikDuT1f4iK75AiLp2YLPsGAb \
  H4XULzfHCf16In2ECk9Ta9QxQPq639zQto2JA3OLlo3JbUdrClvJ89+A1z+Z9POd6l8LJhn1jGpQYF8mX4jkQvE= \
  'Hello, World!'
```

Result:

``` json
true
```

# EncryptWallet

*Requires wallet support.*

The `encryptwallet` RPC encrypts the wallet with a passphrase.  This is only to enable encryption for the first time. After encryption is enabled, you will need to enter the passphrase to use private keys.

{{WARNING}} if using this RPC on the command line, remember
that your shell probably saves your command lines (including the value
of the passphrase parameter). In addition, there is no RPC to completely
disable encryption. If you want to return to an unencrypted wallet, you
must create a new wallet and restore your data from a backup made with
the `dumpwallet` RPC.

*Parameter #1---a passphrase*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Passphrase | string | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The passphrase to use for the encrypted wallet.  Must be at least one character

``` bash
dash-cli -testnet encryptwallet "test"
```

Result:

``` text
Wallet encrypted; Dash Core server stopping, restart to run with encrypted wallet.
The keypool has been flushed and a new HD seed was generated (if you are using
HD). You need to make a new backup.

```

*See also*

* [WalletPassphrase](/docs/core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-wallet#section-walletpassphrase): stores the wallet decryption key in memory for the indicated number of seconds. Issuing the `walletpassphrase` command while the wallet is already unlocked will set a new unlock time that overrides the old one.
* [WalletLock](/docs/core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-wallet#section-walletlock): removes the wallet encryption key from memory, locking the wallet. After calling this method, you will need to call `walletpassphrase` again before being able to call any methods which require the wallet to be unlocked.
* [WalletPassphraseChange](/docs/core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-wallet#section-walletpassphrasechange): changes the wallet passphrase from 'old passphrase' to 'new passphrase'.

# GetAccount

`genkey` | Generates a base64 encoded 256 bit AES key that can be used for the communication with KeePassHttp. This is only necessary for manual configuration.
`init` | Sets up the association between Dash Core and KeePass by generating an AES key and sending an association message to KeePassHttp. This will trigger KeePass to ask for an Id for the association. Returns the association and the base64 encoded string for the AES key.
`setpassphrase` | Updates the passphrase in KeePassHttp to a new value. This should match the passphrase you intend to use for the wallet. Please note that the standard RPC commands walletpassphrasechange and the wallet encryption from the QT GUI already send the updates to KeePassHttp, so this is only necessary for manual manipulation of the password.
